So far in this lesson I have learned about html and that tags and divs are significant to the html. Html's always starts with tags and html tags come in pairs. <br> Under the html tags, there are the head tags with the body tags in them. All the divs go into the body tags. The tags h1, h2, h3... are for headlines. In divs, you can add links for many things, <br> like songs or images for backgrounds. So far I have used this feature to add images for the background on the homepage. It is also important to add br tags for breaks in between words, <br> which I have used in the journal entries.

I have also learned about text and to make the links to the journals, about me, and projects I had to use buttons in my divs. I was able to make my desired sizing for the words and put an image background for it. <br>When you hover over the image, it fades into another color which I learned by using the hover tag for the button tags. It gives the buttons a background which animates. To be able to write in the button, <br> tags I had to create other html folders that linked to the words journal, projects, and about me.

So far, learning about animations I can code is really interesting because I can make certain squares or images move. You have to use a tag called a keyframes in order to make the animation<br> the picture will have. I used a gif from the internet with an animated background color for my animation. What I also found interesting about animations is that it can be set to repeat infinite times, so it never stops. Someone in my class made their whole background a cool animation of individual shapes moving, which I would like to try one time. I also pushed my website today onto the internet which I find interesting because now its on the internet for literally anyone to see my work.
