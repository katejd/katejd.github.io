So far in this lesson I have learned about html and that tags and divs are significant to the html. Html's always starts with tags and html tags come in pairs. <br> Under the html tags, there are the head tags with the body tags in them. All the divs go into the body tags. The tags h1, h2, h3... are for headlines. In divs, you can add links for many things, <br> like songs or images for backgrounds. So far I have used this feature to add images for the background on the homepage. It is also important to add br tags for breaks in between words, <br> which I have used in the journal entries.

I have also learned about text and to make the links to the journals, about me, and projects I had to use buttons in my divs. I was able to make my desired sizing for the words and put an image background for it. <br>When you hover over the image, it fades into another color which I learned by using the hover tag for the button tags. It gives the buttons a background which animates. To be able to write in the button, <br> tags I had to create other html folders that linked to the words journal, projects, and about me.

So far, learning about animations I can code is really interesting because I can make certain squares or images move. You have to use a tag called a keyframes in order to make the animation<br> the picture will have. I used a gif from the internet with an animated background color for my animation. What I also found interesting about animations is that it can be set to repeat infinite times, so it never stops. Someone in my class made their whole background a cool animation of individual shapes moving, which I would like to try one time. I also pushed my website today onto the internet which I find interesting because now its on the internet for literally anyone to see my work.

For the codesketch that includes music, the start of it was very hard and I did not understand what I was doing very well. It still is a bit confusing but I understand the basics for counting the clicks to change backgrounds. But I am especially confused about adding audio, since I can't seem to find an audio that is able to turn into an Mp3. I want to really start to make my preojects more complicated but I am just not sure how to get there. I wanted to add music for when you press on the gif in the codesketch, but I'm not sure how to go about that. I would also like some more writing on it or better patterns happening in the background. It would also be cooler if I could do the thing where there's a shape in front of a word and when you hover or click it fades away and you're able to see what you've written. There is an event listener used to play and stop the music.

I was able to add the music how I wanted for the codesketch and it's still not the best but I like it. For the codesketch with the array, it is definietkly basic. I still don't understand these projects to the fullest, so I'm not sure how to customize it so it's different than the template code. I added pictures of flowers in rainbow order but there's no special element to it. I want to make the spaces of the pictures smoother and maybe add some sort of effect to it, like the pictures fade when you hover over it, but I can never really do that. I want to expand on the array codesketch more when I come back to class.

With the array project, I wasn't able to figure out how to do the things I wanted. I understand how you write a list and it randomly generates it, but I was trying to use images and the urls wouldn't work. With quotes it would just write out the url, and with out quotes it wouldn't register it because with the two slashes (/), it would hide the text. I also want to be able to click it and stop the generator, so you would choose a random one but I also wasn't able to figure that out. Again, I'm hoping I can figure it out in class because my array is not fully how I want it to be.

After making a lab to edit my array, we customized it to how I wanted it. To add photos instead of words for the array, I had to put images in my katejd.github folder and label it with png. I was then able to write the names in quotes so the images show up, like to make tacos.png show up I wrote "tacos". When it randomizes the images, you need a function with counter and have counter equal 0, this will mean the images will start at the first image at 0, and then in the event listener you add counter = counter +1, so the numbers go up 1 everytime and the images will show up in a random order. I wanted to make it start and stop when you press it, so it lands on a random image. Under the eventlistener I added, if(counter %2 ==1){play = setInterval(scrollImages, 200). This means that any number divided(%) by 2 has an odd remainder, like 1, every click that's odd will play the function. So when starting at 0 and doing your first click, when you click it'll play the function. I then had to add, else if (counter %2 == 0){clearInterval(play)};. This means that even numbered clicks like 0, will pause the function. So when you click for the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc time, it'll pause the function and it'll land on a randomized image. Going to the lab helped and I was able to customize my project as I wanted to.
